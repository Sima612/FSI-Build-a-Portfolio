        <p>Hi, my name is Rachasima Tran, but I typically go by Sima. I'm quick on my feet, responsible, and very well-organized.<br> 
          My primary specialty in the work industry is overall fitness (e.g., weight loss, strength and conditioning, functional fitness, etc.)<br> 
          Although my resume is mainly health fitness, I see myself as qualified in any other entry-level position as I am easily coachable and a quick learner.<br>
          I mainly work better in a work environment, but I can also be an exceptional team player.
        </p>
